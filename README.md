# Limitations
My first MERN project. Limitations are things in which people would like to limit from their lifestyle. This project lets users list their limitations into a calendar where they can update the limitations. Each limitation can be made a day, week, month, or "custom" long (custom being the days from the inputed start date to the inputed end date). They are also made with a chosen start and end date, name, and amount that will be limited. Limitations will be deleted from the database when the quantity has been met or exceeded after being updated or the end date has been past.

I have left the mongoose.connect in server/index.js with "/Add Connection Here/" for you to modify to get it to work.
